2.0 Batch File Information
________________________________________________________________________________________

	For those of you scrubs not familiar with command prompt commands I made some
	batch commands located in the "bat" directory.

	1.	"InstallPackages.bat" - Installs all packages listed in the "package.json",
		this is were we would add MongoDB and other fancy technologies.

	2.	"ServerStart.bat" - Starts a local instance of the server for rapid
		development.
