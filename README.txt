2.0 Batch File Information
________________________________________________________________________________________

	For those of you scrubs not familiar with command prompt commands I made some
	batch commands located in the "bat" directory.

	1.	"InstallPackages.bat" - Installs all packages listed in the
		"package.json", this is were we would add MongoDB and other fancy
		technologies.

	2.	"StartServer.bat" - Starts a local instance of the server for
		development. Use (Ctrl C) to end the instance of the server.
	
(TODO)	3.	"RestartServer.bat" - You will need to restart the server every time
		you modify a file that is NOT a view, views just need a page refresh.
		Because of the constant need to restart, I suggest setting up a macro
		to call this bat file on a single key stroke. (tutorial?)
